# Cybersecurity lab simulating Windows attacks and monitoring with Wazuh SIEM in a Proxmox virtual environment.
## Wazuh-SIEM-on-Proxmox
Built a SIEM environment by deploying Wazuh inside Proxmox on a base Ubuntu Server.     Designed to collect, analyze, and visualize security events in a virtualized lab

## Brief about the Project 
It is a Proxmox Worstation which has Ubuntu as the base VM for Wazzuh. Wazzuh server is configure to receive alert updates. Windows 10 is the victim machine that has Wazzuh agent installed and Kali is the attacker. When Kali is exploting the SMB open port on Windows10 , alerts are automatically generated on Wazzuh.

## Main Requirements 
### Proxmox Workstation
- Proxmox as the bare bone hypervisor on a Workstation
- Ubuntu as the base operating system for Wazuh
- Wazuh installed on Ubuntu
### Windows Laptop with VMWare (VM Machines on the same network subnet)
- Windows 10 as the victim machine
- Kali as the attacker machine

## Process 
All the virtual machines are on the same network. They are in the subnet range of 10.0.0.0/24. 

#### The environment in the project can be described by the following image 
<img width="200" height="469" alt="Picture24" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6f023ec8-0845-43fa-ba8e-7be8650e0ab3" />

## Starting point 
As with all the CTF like environment the first and foremost thing I have done is scanning an active subnet of 10.0.0.0. And after the NMap scanning the open ports on Window 10 (victim) machine was discovered as shown in the picture. 

<img width="600" height="97" alt="Pictur7" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f7a1c411-cbd3-4024-8971-a4d74921ff73" />

In this scenario, several ports on the victim machine were found to be open: TCP/135, TCP/139, and TCP/445.
- ‚úÖ I exploited TCP/445 by using Windows Server Message Block (SMB) to establish a remote connection to the victim‚Äôs computer.
- üñ•Ô∏è Once I gained access to the victim‚Äôs machine, since Wazuh was configured to monitor it, the server immediately generated an alert.

 #### üîî The alert included:
- üïí The correct timestamp of the attack
- üö® The nature of the attack, indicating the remote connection via SMB
- üìå This shows how important it is to have Wazuh monitoring critical ports and services, as it helps detect unauthorized access in real-time.
## Cracking the password 
I have used John the Ripper built inside of Kali to extract the password and use a common list in this case Rockyou to crack the password 

## Successful exploit
The sucessful shell access can be shown by the picture. 

<img width="600" height="103" alt="Picture6767" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/57e5095f-d9b1-47c1-992a-d8c1c982705f" />

## Wazzuh alerts 
In this scenario, a successful exploit was carried out on a Windows machine. The Wazuh server detected the activity and generated alerts that help us understand the nature and details of the attack.

‚úÖ As the exploit was successful, the Wazuh server started producing alerts.
üîî We can see the type of alert generated, which indicates:
A successful logon to the Windows machine via Remote Desktop (RDP).
üïí The alert also includes:
The timestamp of when the attack occurred.

üåê IP address details:
- Victim machine IP: 10.0.0.133
- Attacker machine IP: 10.0.0.130

üìå In this scenario, having a Wazuh server generating alerts is very useful to:
Detect if any kind of attack is happening on the machine.

üñ•Ô∏è Since Wazuh is a host-based intrusion detection system (HIDS):
It is essential to have the Wazuh agent installed on the machine being monitored.

‚ö†Ô∏è Wazuh provides a variety of alerts, including:
When a user logs into the system
When apps or services request elevated privileges
When there is a clear sign of an attack, like:
Remote Desktop access being established on the victim‚Äôs computer

### Report Generated 

<img width="600" height="901" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c2d9b008-b44d-4da1-954a-4b63682f84b7" />

### üõ°Ô∏è Wazuh Alerts Summary
This table acts as a security event log, detailing every activity and potential threat detected by the Wazuh agent. It gives a clear, itemized account of what's happening on the monitored system.

- Diverse Events at a Glance: The table is a blend of routine system events and critical security alerts. You can see mundane actions like a user logging off (Rule ID 60137) right next to high-priority events like a successful remote logon (Rule ID 92657).
- The Power of Specifics: Each entry is a specific data point. For instance, the Apparmor DENIED entry shows a count of 38, indicating that this specific security policy has been triggered multiple times. This isn't just a general alert; it's a specific number pointing to a recurring event.
- Drilling Down on a High-Risk Event: The highlighted entry is a perfect example of Wazuh's detailed analysis. It identifies a successful remote logon with a high severity level. The description isn't vague; it specifies the user (kali) and even suggests a possible attack vector (pass-the-hash). Crucially, it provides an actionable recommendation: "Verify that KALI is allowed to perform RDP connections." This moves the alert from a simple notification to a task for an analyst to investigate.
